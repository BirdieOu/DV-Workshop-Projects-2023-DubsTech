# DV-Workshop-Projects-2023-DubsTech
A data visualization project collection - Data Visualization Certificate Program (DubsTech@UniversityOfWashington)
Feb 2023 - Mar 2023
I attened a series of virtual workshops hosted by UW's DubsTech. Through their interactive program, I have learnt to use two popular Data Visualization tools Power BI and Tableau from scratch.

Project 1: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kIozLjKmmv3Z1yyqmzsKJvLncK51KnI2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Retail Analytics with Power BI Data Viz Workshop Project </a>
About the project: A fashion startup needs a business intelligence solution that provides the following insights: 
What are the sales for each product category?
What is the relationship between unit selling price & quantity for each product?
What are the total orders received by time?
For a specific product style: 
What is the total quantity sold over time?
What is the total quantity sold by state and city?
What is the total quantity sold by size?
What is the all time total sales, avg unit price, and units sold of the product?

Project 2: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winifred.huang/viz/U_SDRGReportForLilyMedicare/HospitalFinderDashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Geo Spatial Analysis in Tableau Workshop Project </a>
About the project: A startup seeking to build data driven dashboards and reports for those seeking medical treatment and who are facing problems in financing heavy medical bills (especially soon to be retiring elderly people). 
The Tableau project is providing the following insights: 
Which *DRG has the most discharges? 
Which Body System has the most discharges?
Discharges Dashboard: Allow a user to - Select a DRG - Select if they wish to see states in continental USA only - Select a Time Period
Then See:  A map of states with the total discharges 
Hospital Finder Dashboard: Using only 2015 data, make a dashboard that allows a user to:  - Select their DRG  - Enter their budget (average total payment) using a slider 
And then see: A map of hospitals that serve this DRG
*A Diagnosis Related Group is a classification system of classifying any inpatient into groups for the purpose of hospital payments. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivides them into almost 500 groups for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement. 


Project 3: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/136lxHQBrCLBf0PF9mXZJ3qtHPInn1Eeo/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Health Analytics with Power BI Data Viz Workshop Project </a>
About the project: A podcaster writes a report on the state of COVID-19 across the world every week for the New York Times. To help her write a data driven report this week, she has found a COVID-19 worldwide dataset but it does not quickly give her the insights she wants. She needs build an analytics report for her that provides the following insights: 
What are the total active cases by country?
What are the total active cases, recovered cases, and deaths in a specific country? 
What are the total deaths vs total recovered for all countries in the world?
